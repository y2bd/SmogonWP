SmogonWP
========

SmogonWP is a Windows Phone client for Smogon (http://smogon.com). It also has some non-Smogon stuff that's still relevant to the world of Pokemon.

The app is currently on the Windows Phone store! You can [download it here](http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/smogonwp/94a8cbff-c35e-462f-998d-d73d4e75ca72). If that link doesn't work you, try searching for *SmogonWP* in the store app itself, the app should be available in all regions for all WP8 devices.
